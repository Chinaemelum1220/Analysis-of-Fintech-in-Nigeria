40% of the competitors make use of transaction fees
For subscription-based banking services, premium accounts are charged between ₦500-₦2000/month, offering benefits like overdrafts and cashback.
#### Gaps in the Market
-  **Digital Payments:** While digital payments dominate the market, most competitors use transaction fees, which can be costly for frequent users. There is also limited adoption of subscription-based models in this segment
-  **Micro-Lending:** Many microlending platforms charge high interest rates (e.g., 10-30%) and processing fees, which can deter borrowers, especially students and small business owners.
-  **Blockchain Services:** Blockchain services are still niche, with limited adoption among small business owners and other key segments. Many competitors focus on cryptocurrency trading, leaving gaps in areas like secure transactions and supply chain management.
-  **AI Financial Tools:** Financial tools are underutilized, especially among informal sector workers who could benefit from budgeting and financial planning tools.
